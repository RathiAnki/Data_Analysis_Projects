"This dataset was introduced to me by Ankit Bansal, who used Python and SQL for data cleaning and analysis. However, I handled this dataset entirely in SQL Server, guided by his approach, and presented the visualizations using Power BI. Iâ€™m also sharing the YouTube link to the same for further reference."
