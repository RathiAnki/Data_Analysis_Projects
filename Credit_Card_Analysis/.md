**ðŸ’³ Credit Card Transactions â€“ SQL Case Study**


This case study involves comprehensive SQL analysis on a dataset of credit card transactions, with the aim to derive meaningful insights into consumer behavior, spending patterns, and city/card performance across multiple dimensions. Below are the key business questions addressed and the respective SQL solutions implemented.

**Business Questions & Solutions**

**1. write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends **

with city_exp as (

Select city, sum(amount) as city_spend 
from credit_card_transcations
group by city)

, total_spend as(

Select sum(cast(amount as bigint)) as total_spend from credit_card_transcations)

Select top 5  city, city_spend,round(c.city_spend*1.0/t.total_spend*100,2) as percentage_contribution
from city_exp c	
join total_spend t
on 1=1
order by percentage_contribution desc

**2. write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type.**

**-- sub_query**

select card_type, mo, total_spend from (

Select card_type, mo, total_spend,rank()over(partition by card_type order by total_spend desc) rn from 
(Select  card_type,Datename(month,transaction_date)  as mo,sum(amount)  as total_spend
from credit_card_transcations
group by card_type,Datename(month,transaction_date)  ) a) b
where rn =1;


**-- CTE**

with monthly_spend as(

Select  card_type,month(transaction_date) as mo,sum(amount)  as total_spend
from credit_card_transcations
group by card_type,month(transaction_date))

,  ranked_monthly_spend as (
Select card_type, mo, total_spend,rank()over(partition by card_type order by total_spend desc) rn 
from monthly_spend)

select card_type, mo, total_spend
from ranked_monthly_spend
where rn =1;

**3.write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type 
when it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type)**

with cte as(

select *,
sum(amount) over(partition by card_type order by transaction_date,transaction_id )as running_sum
from credit_card_transcations)
, flagged as(
Select *, rank() over(partition by card_type order by running_sum) as rn
from cte
where running_sum>= 1000000)

select transaction_id,city,transaction_date,card_type,exp_type,gender,amount,running_sum from flagged
where rn =1

**4. write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type**

with city_wise as(

Select city, sum(amount) as gold_citywise_spend
from credit_card_transcations
where card_type='Gold'
group by city)

, total_spend as(

Select city, sum(amount) as total_citywise_amount
from credit_card_transcations
group by city)

Select top 1 city from (

Select c.city,c.gold_citywise_spend,t.total_citywise_amount,
c.gold_citywise_spend*100.0/t.total_citywise_amount as percent_contri
from city_wise c
join total_spend t
on c.city =t.city
) a 
order by percent_contri

**5.write a query to print 3 columns:  city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)**

with expense_by_type as(

Select city, exp_type, sum(amount) as total_amount
from credit_card_transcations
group by city, exp_type)

,ranked_exp as(

Select  city, exp_type,
rank() over(partition by city order by total_amount desc) as max_rank,
rank() over(partition by city order by total_amount ) as min_rank
from expense_by_type
)

, highest_exp as (

Select city, exp_type as highest_expense_type from ranked_exp
			where max_rank =1)

, lowest_exp as (

select city, exp_type as lowest_expense_type from ranked_exp
			where min_rank =1)

Select h.city, h.highest_expense_type,l.lowest_expense_type
	 from

	join lowest_exp l
	on h.city =l.city
